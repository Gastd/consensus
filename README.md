# consensus

## Overview

consensus is ROS package used to test cooperative controllers with mobile robots in the Laboratory of Automation and Robotics at University of Brasilia.

The code in this package can be used either with **simulated robots** or with **real robots**:

The consensus package has been tested under the following softwares:

* This software was tested in Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04
* [ROS Kinetic](https://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) and [ROS Melodic](https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
* Gazebo 9.0.0

 This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.

## Build on ROS

Clone this repository to your catkin workspace.

```bash
cd ${YOUR_WORKSPACE_PATH}/src
git clone https://github.com/Gastd/consensus.git
cd ../
catkin_make
```


## Run the Simulation
The Simulation uses the well known Gazebo Simulated that is shiped with ROS. 

* Before running the simulation, you must to download our robots description.

    ```bash
    cd ${YOUR_WORKSPACE_PATH}/src
    git clone https://github.com/lara-unb/aramis.git
    git clone https://github.com/lara-unb/athos.git
    git clone https://github.com/lara-unb/porthos.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    ```

Run the simulation to test the code:

* In a terminal with your ros workspace
    ```
    roslaunch consenus simulation.launch
    ```

This will open the Gazebo with the robots in posistion and ready to go.


## Algorithms
* `flocking_leader.py` and `flocking_agents.py` implements the control system proposed in the following article:

    ```
    @article{zhao2017,
      title={Flocking of multi-agent nonholonomic systems with unknown leader dynamics and relative measurements},
      author={Zhao, Xiao-Wen and Guan, Zhi-Hong and Li, Juan and Zhang, Xian-He and Chen, Chao-Yang},
      journal={International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control},
      volume={27},
      number={17},
      pages={3685--3702},
      year={2017},
      publisher={Wiley Online Library}
    }
    ```

There is a launch file that calls the controllers for each one of the robots including the _virtual_ leader.
    
    roslaunch consensus sim_flocking.launch


And the `flocking_agents.launch` will run only one controller and must be used in each robot's computer.
The `display.launch` will open the RViz and will show the robots and its path when they move.
The `flocking_leader.py` implements the _virtual_ leader and can be used with `rosrun`:

    rosrun consensus flocking_leader.py


* `double_integrator.py` implements
